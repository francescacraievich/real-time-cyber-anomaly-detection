# Real-Time Cyber Anomaly Detection Platform

## 1. Team and Roles
| Member | Role |
|--------|------|
| Francesca Craievich | Project Manager |
| Lucas Jakin | ML engineer |
| Francesco Rumiz | Data scientist |

---

## 2. Project Objective
Design a **data-driven** platform for real-time anomaly detection in network and system logs. The system should be able to identify:

- Sudden traffic spikes from a single IP
- Repeated failed login attempts (brute force)
- Unusual behavior from hosts or users
- Connections to unusual ports or destinations

The ultimate goal is to generate **automatic alerts** and display anomalous events in an **interactive dashboard**.

## 3. General Architecture

Network / System Logs -> Stream Ingestion Layer (Kafka / MQTT / Python Script) ->  Stream Processing & Anomaly Detection (ML Model + Rules) -> Storage Layer (PostgreSQL / MongoDB / InfluxDB) -> Dashboard / Alerting (Streamlit / Grafana / Web App)
